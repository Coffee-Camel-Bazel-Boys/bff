# bff (Backend For Frontend)
This app is a simple Perl mojolicious application that forwards to services and handles customer facing logic.

# How to spin-up

```bash
docker-compose up
```

# Note

This app is virtually useless without having the [backend](https://github.com/Coffee-Camel-Bazel-Boys/garden-land) spun up. So make sure you do that.
